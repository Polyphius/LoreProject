### AMF ([[AMF#Project Archangel|Project Archangel]])
- Faster Activating (almost instant), not chemical based, wears off in about a day for shrink, in a couple hours for growth.
- Relies on an otherworldly entity for further development. 
- Process is incredibly energy intensive, and currently extremely expensive.
- Entity responsible for it's creation no longer under AMF control.
- Development has plateaued at a point where there are these drawbacks, all efforts now focused on making it cheaper.
- Subjects are extremely delicate when small, but extremely strong when large.
- Effect can be used offensively in the form of electromagnetic pulses, however this requires specialized equipment that needs to be mounted to a vehicle to be portable at all.
### Equinox ([[Equinox#Project Sarvus|Project Sarvus]])
- Acts over about 30s.
- Still rather expensive, but chemical based so can be manufactured.
- Subjects are still extremely delicate when small.
- Effect does not wear off unless an anti-compound is administered.
- Subjects can shrink smaller than Project Archangel, with the limit being 1/250 rather than 1/175.
- Effect can be used offensively in the form of gas grenades or poison.
### CGL
- Radiation Based, Cheap
- Irreversible.
- Results in a loss of original body, an ability to clone a vessel is needed for it to be effective.
- Memories are transferred between "lives" via a quantum entanglement like phenomena altering the original capture as the current clone creates new memories.
