# AMF
## Aegis Mercenary Front (1992-2003)
Founded shortly after the implosion of the soviet union by soviet oligarchs, AMF quickly rose to dominate the Eastern European underground arms trade due to the surplus of weaponry now left idle in the many remote military stations from St Petersburg to Yakutsk. During the first decade of the company's operations contracts and dealings were relatively mundane, with the majority of operations being that of private security, training and advisory for less experienced European countries (specifically the Baltic states) and asset protection. 

However, as the company began to expand, and as technology as it pertains to warfare began to evolve in the early years of the new millennium, AMF began its operations across the Atlantic. With the presence of a Russian founded mercenary group operating on American soil being almost impossible, obfuscation and regulatory loopholes were required to continue this operation. 
## Altus Military Formulations (2003-Present)
In October of 2003, a separate company was founded primarily based in research, and not on overt militaristic activity. Despite the change in stated operation, AMF still actively hired and was allowed to operate (with extreme regulation) on American soil as private security for those that could afford it. This included the acquisition of licences to operate military grade firearms and equipment.
Although deniable as of the present day, it is speculated that since as early as the mid 2000s, AMF has received funding through indirect means through both CCP and Russian channels. 
AMF as a company has been incredibly successful in their research endeavours, filing multiple lucrative patents throughout the late 2000s ranging from advanced radar tech, anti-air munitions specifically designed to counter the growing use of drones in aerial warfare.
## Project Archangel
In November 2015, AMF operated satellites over central Europe detected an object entering the atmosphere at Mach 8.7, quickly altering its trajectory in a way unlike any before it. Upon noticing that this object was not decreasing in mass upon entry into the atmosphere, a team of personnel was sent to the projected landing site at [REDACTED] northeast of the town of [REDACTED]. When asked for public comment, AMF Spokesmen in conjunction with the government of [REDACTED] stated that the object was a regular small meteorite with nothing out of the ordinary.
What was recovered is unknown, however in the years that followed, AMF's rollout of patents and technology collaborations would slow to a crawl.
Details of this project are kept incredibly classified, with the board of shareholders only knowing it by name and it not existing on public record, and being assured that whatever losses the company may incur by having their top scientists working almost entirely on it was more than worth it. 
Whatever was shown behind closed doors was enough to keep the stock price afloat.

### Archangel Protocols and Effects [CLASSIFIED]
- Project Archangel is the reverse engineering of an entity discovered at the 2015 crash site.
- The Entity is to be contained in a locked cell 150m underground within the [REDACTED] facility under 24 hour surveillance. 
- The Entity can communicate in a way understandable to humans, and has agreed to cooperate in the development of reverse engineering its technology with the agreement that it is used for a noble cause. 
- The primary effect being replicated is the alteration of the state of an entity's physical scale. The entity possesses the ability to grow and shrink its self and others at will. This effect does not extend to inanimate objects, excluding any matter in direct contact with the organic matter of the subject effected.
- The effect is not chemical, thermal or radiation based, but appears to effect the electromagnetic effect of the subject during the process.
	- Shrinking organic matter can be done with a magnetic pulse not too dissimilar to an EMP.
- The effect has been duplicated independent of the entity as of 2021, but with major drawbacks that only make it suitable for limited operations as an offensive weapon.
	- Subjects can be shrunk to 1/175th scale, but the effect only lasts for as long as 26hrs, with the effect lasting on average about 23 hours.
		- This is currently used for covert espionage operations.
	- Subjects can be grown to 15x their original scale, however the effect only lasts on average 15m. However this has shown to vary wildly depending on an individuals tolerance (what determines this tolerance is currently unknown).
	- Subjects do not maintain durability at smaller sizes, and shows the same effects on the human sensory system as [[Equinox#Project Asthenis|Equinox's Asthenis Project]].
#### 2023 Protocol Breach Incident [CLASSIFIED]
- As of January 9th, 2023, AMF has lost control of the entity, its whereabouts unknown. This is a direct result of a leak caused by a former employee that informed the entity of the purpose of the research and the corporation's intent to use it as a weapon. 
- Said employee cannot be killed at this time, as a dead mans switch is in place that if triggered, is speculated to leak the details of Project Archangel to the press.

*As of today, AMF has two primary objectives.*
- AMF are currently looking for a way to make the scale altering aspect of the technology cheaper as right now it is unsustainably expensive to maintain.
- AMF are searching to either recapture the entity, or find a suitable replacement.
