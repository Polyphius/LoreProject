#### Characters and OC Consistency
Characters within this universe exist in two distinct categories, designed to allow for easy collaboration with other artists and or friends that wish to collaborate in any way. This universe is meant to house primarily OCs that belong to specific people, not established characters from existing media.
##### Internal Characters
- Characters that I have made and/or have ownership of, these characters have this universe as their "base" reality, with events that take place within it affecting their canon.
- Characters that were not made by me, but were made specifically for this universe. Although the main universe of this character is this one, if the creator of said character wishes to have them exist outside of it in other pieces or stories then I have no objections or retain any of the rights to said character.
##### External Characters
- Characters that I do not own or have the rights to, unless stated otherwise by the respective owner this universe has no affect on the canon behaviour of said character. These characters can be retconned at any time but as a request please don't have them have too much impact on the storyline if you see this being a possibility down the line.
- These characters can act in any way that their owners wish so long as they adhere to the lore of this storyline.
- *The best way to think of these characters are almost "cameos"* that could either be one offs, or have a significant impact on the trajectory of the storyline.
- By default, characters exist as "alternate universe" instances of themselves, however if you wish for characters to be "teleported" or be transported to this universe in some kind of supernatural event that's also fine. Or if you're not too fussed at all and just want these characters to exist as their normal selves that's cool too.
#### Rules for External Characters
- The rules of this setting are pretty relaxed, supernatural powers, events and "magic" of sorts can exist, just as long as these don't cause world altering events or destruction anything goes.
- As for size, characters are allowed to magically grow/shrink at will if that character possesses that ability, however if they are relatively normal then they must follow the in universe [[Size Tech|size tech]].
