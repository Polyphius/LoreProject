#### What is This?
- A while ago I thought it would be a neat idea to connect renders that I've made with my own characters in a shared storyline. Why? Because creative writing is a fun part of this hobby and it's a neat extra layer of detail for those that pay attention. This collection of pages is intended to serve as a hub mainly for myself to ensure that there's some degree of coherence and consistency across renders that take place within this "universe".
- As I shared proof of concepts, some people expressed an interest in having their characters interact with this universe. Others I reached out to with an interest in including their characters as one offs or cameos. If you want to know how external OCs exist within this setting, [[Character Types and Guidelines|read this]].
