# CGL
CGL is the acronym given to a university thesis by a single researcher out of NY. Not much is known about the paper other than it's abstract, however it is known that *Dr. Amy Kobayashi* is credited on the abstract for the paper as a contributor. The original paper has been scrubbed from the internet as well as the researcher's location at this time.

>Investigating the use of concentrated, refracted gamma radiation on the molecular structure of organic material, as well as the use of this procedure as a way to create memetic captures of a the human consciousness. It is theorized that the "miniaturization" of organic matter allowed by this procedure will make the ability to create rewritable "snapshots" of the human memory possible through rapid...

### CGL Paper Applications: Consciousness Transfer [CLASSIFIED]
- The paper outlines a procedure that creates an identical clone of a subject using radioactive "photogrammetry" to create a snapshot of what equates to a human soul. This data can then be rasterized and copied into a vessel of choice.
- The consciousness data exists in two states:
	- As a radioactive signature created by the [REDACTED] process. Referred to as *Copy A-1*.
	- As a Digital state copied from *A-1*, this is static and unchanging, known as *A-2*.
- State *A-1* dynamically changes, whether this be through quantum entanglement or some other mechanism is unknown.
- Before a subject is cloned, a digital (*A-2*) copy of the consciousness is created which appears to contain all of the memories of that "soul" at the time of the digital copy's creation. 
- An unfortunate side effect of this process is upon creation of *A-1*, the dynamic copy, the original host dies.
- It is speculated that the ability to transfer a mock consciousness was tested before the researcher conducted the procedure on themselves.
- At this time, the researcher exists in a state of perpetual death, copy and transfer. The motives for this are unknown, but is speculated to be some kind of accelerated natural selection/evolution process.

As of this time, CGL is on the radar of both [[AMF]] and [[Equinox]] however AMF appear to be delving deeper into the matter, sending multiple archival retrieval requests to the university for the original paper.

>CGL is mostly peripheral to the main plot, and exists mainly in self contained scenarios.
