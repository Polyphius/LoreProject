 <br><br><br>Founded shortly after the implosion of the soviet union by soviet oligarchs, AMF quickly rose to dominate the Eastern European underground arms trade due to the surplus of weaponry now left idle in the many remote military stations from St Petersburg to Yakutsk. During the first decade of the company's operations contracts and dealings were relatively mundane, with the majority of operations being that of private security, training and advisory for less experienced European countries (specifically the Baltic states) and asset protection. <br>However, as the company began to expand, and as technology as it pertains to warfare began to evolve in the early years of the new millennium, AMF began its operations across the Atlantic. With the presence of a Russian founded mercenary group operating on American soil being almost impossible, obfuscation and regulatory loopholes were required to continue this operation. <br><br>In October of 2003, a separate company was founded primarily based in research, and not on overt militaristic activity. Despite the change in stated operation, AMF still actively hired and was allowed to operate (with extreme regulation) on American soil as private security for those that could afford it. This included the acquisition of licences to operate military grade firearms and equipment.<br>
Although deniable as of the present day, it is speculated that since as early as the mid 2000s, AMF has received funding through indirect means through both CCP and Russian channels.<br>
AMF as a company has been incredibly successful in their research endeavours, filing multiple lucrative patents throughout the late 2000s ranging from advanced radar tech, anti-air munitions specifically designed to predict drone flight patterns as well as being involved with the DARPA HTV-2 Project in 2011 (although uncredited).<br><br>In November 2015, AMF operated satellites over central Europe detected an object entering the atmosphere at Mach 8.7, quickly altering its trajectory in a way unlike any before it. Upon noticing that this object was not decreasing in mass upon entry into the atmosphere, a team of personnel was sent to the projected landing site at [REDACTED] northeast of the town of [REDACTED]. When asked for public comment, AMF Spokesmen in conjunction with the government of [REDACTED] stated that the object was a regular small meteorite with nothing out of the ordinary.<br>
What was recovered is unknown, however in the years that followed, AMF's rollout of patents and technology collaborations would slow to a crawl.<br>
Details of this project are kept incredibly classified, with the board of shareholders only knowing it by name and it not existing on public record, and being assured that whatever losses the company may incur by having their top scientists working almost entirely on it was more than worth it.<br>
Whatever was shown behind closed doors was enough to keep the stock price afloat. <br><img alt="10686_2021_9828_Fig19_HTML.png" src="poly-lore-diagram\_attachments\10686_2021_9828_fig19_html.png" style="width: 450px; max-width: 100%;"><br><br>
<br>Project Archangel is the reverse engineering of an entity discovered at the 2015 crash site.
<br>The Entity is to be contained in a locked cell 150m underground within the [REDACTED] facility under 24 hour surveillance. 
<br>The Entity can communicate in a way understandable to humans, and has agreed to cooperate in the development of reverse engineering its technology with the agreement that it is used for a noble cause. 
<br>The primary effect being replicated is the alteration of the state of an entity's physical scale. The entity possesses the ability to grow and shrink its self and others at will. This effect does not extend to inanimate objects, excluding any matter in direct contact with the organic matter of the subject effected.
<br>The effect is not chemical, thermal or radiation based, but appears to effect the electromagnetic effect of the subject during the process.

<br>Shrinking organic matter can be done with a magnetic pulse not too dissimilar to an EMP.


<br>The effect has been duplicated independent of the entity as of 2021, but with major drawbacks that only make it suitable for limited operations as an offensive weapon.

<br>Subjects can be shrunk to 1/175th scale, but the effect only lasts for as long as 26hrs, with the effect lasting on average about 23 hours.

<br>This is currently used for covert espionage operations.


<br>Subjects can be grown to 15x their original scale, however the effect only lasts on average 15m. However this has shown to vary wildly depending on an individuals tolerance (what determines this tolerance is currently unknown).
<br>Subjects do not maintain durability at smaller sizes, and shows the same effects on the human sensory system as <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Equinox > Project Asthenis" data-href="Equinox#Project Asthenis" href="poly-lore-diagram\equinox.html#Project_Asthenis" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Equinox's Asthenis Project</a>.


<br><br>
<br>As of January 9th, 2023, AMF has lost control of the entity, its whereabouts unknown. This is a direct result of a leak caused by a former employee that informed the entity of the purpose of the research and the corporation's intent to use it as a weapon. 
<br>Said employee cannot be killed at this time, as a dead mans switch is in place that if triggered, is speculated to leak the details of Project Archangel to the press.
<br>As of today, AMF has two primary objectives.<br>
<br>AMF are currently looking for a way to make the scale altering aspect of the technology cheaper as right now it is unsustainably expensive to maintain.
<br>AMF are searching to either recapture the entity, or find a suitable replacement.

 <br><br>CGL is the acronym given to a university thesis by a single researcher out of NY. Not much is known about the paper other than it's abstract, however it is known that Dr. Amy Kobayashi is credited on the abstract for the paper as a contributor. The original paper has been scrubbed from the internet as well as the researcher's location at this time. <br>Paper Abstract: (Taken from Wayback Machine)<br>
Investigating the use of concentrated, refracted gamma radiation on the molecular structure of organic material, as well as the use of this procedure as a way to create memetic captures of a the human consciousness. It is theorized that the "miniaturization" of organic matter allowed by this procedure will make the ability to create rewritable "snapshots" of the human memory possible through rapid...

<br>The paper outlines a procedure that creates an identical clone of a subject using radioactive "photogrammetry" to create a snapshot of what equates to a human soul. This data can then be rasterized and copied into a vessel of choice.
<br>The consciousness data exists in two states:

<br>As a radioactive signature created by the [REDACTED] process. Referred to as Copy A-1.
<br>As a Digital state copied from A-1, this is static and unchanging, known as A-2.


<br>State A-1 dynamically changes, whether this be through quantum entanglement or some other mechanism is unknown.
<br>Before a subject is cloned, a digital (A-2) copy of the consciousness is created which appears to contain all of the memories of that "soul" at the time of the digital copy's creation. 
<br>An unfortunate side effect of this process is upon creation of A-1, the dynamic copy, the original host dies.
<br>It is speculated that the ability to transfer a mock consciousness was tested before the researcher conducted the procedure on themselves.
<br>At this time, the researcher exists in a state of perpetual death, copy and transfer. The motives for this are unknown, but is speculated to be some kind of accelerated natural selection/evolution process.
<br>As of this time, CGL is on the radar of both <a data-href="AMF" href="poly-lore-diagram\amf.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">AMF</a> and <a data-href="Equinox" href="poly-lore-diagram\equinox.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Equinox</a> however AMF appear to be delving deeper into the matter, sending multiple archival retrieval requests to the university for the original paper.<br><br>CGL is mostly peripheral to the main plot, and exists mainly in self contained scenarios.]]></description><link>poly-lore-diagram\cgl.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Poly Lore Diagram/CGL.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2024 10:11:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Equinox]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>Founded in 2006, equinox is an American owned and operated private military company with a research division that hires an incredibly large amount of former government employees. It has long been speculated that Equinox has deep ties to the US government, with many top executives being former members of the intelligence community.<br>
Equinox was formed as a direct response to <a data-href="AMF" href="poly-lore-diagram\amf.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">AMF</a>, another company operating on US soil with similar goals, output, and an equally as impressive history of impressive patents.<br>Despite Equinox being primarily known within the scientific community for their patents, the majority of its revenue comes from private military contract work, with Equinox having the majority of the PMC market share in most of the South American continent, Canada, and parts of the far east. Equinox is the only private military company for example to have presence in the first island chain to the east of China. Domestic PMCs in these countries exist of course, but take primarily "low" status jobs from crime lords and corrupt local politicians. Almost all high end contracts are handled by Equinox employed mercenaries.<br>
This insanely lucrative income stream and dominance of the Asian and South American PMC contract market share, coupled with suspected backing by the intelligence community has positioned Equinox to almost be an almost unofficial branch of the US military. Their only rival being that of AMF, which dominates the European market share.<br><br>In November 2015, researchers at an Equinox Research lab in Arizona discovered that by distilling and boiling in a very specific vacuum 6 different chemical compounds (3 of which are patented by Equinox themselves) in a process not too dissimilar to the manufacturing of Aerogel that a substance could be made that rapidly collapsed the distance between molecules it interacted with. The compound was named "Asthenis" or "AST-8" internally, and was researched in the coming years as a side project with it originally intended to be used to transport cargo much more efficiently.<br>However, by the end of 2020, Project Asthenis, under the guidance of Dr. Amy Kobayashi had reached a stage where a version of the compound could be synthesized that when administered orally, or as a gas with a similar consistency and colour to chlorine gas, could render organic matter from 1:8th to 1:250th in scale depending on the concentration of the substance.<br><br>
<br>Upon ingestion of the compound (AST-8) the subject rapidly shrinks in scale, along with any and all belongings in contact with the subject.

<br>It is for this reason that tests are conducted with an aerosol, rather than ingested orally.


<br>Subjects are observed to remain fully conscious throughout the process, only reporting mild nausea after the compound has fully taken effect. However it is unclear if this nausea is as a result of the procedure, or is simply motion sickness as a result of the drastic perspective difference that occurs at such scales.
<br>The effect can be reversed with an anti-compound of sorts, without this, the scale of the subject remains constant and permanent.
<br>Subjects can only be shrunk, not grown.
<br>It is confirmed that <a data-href="AMF" href="poly-lore-diagram\amf.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">AMF</a> knows of the project, and have sent mercenaries to attempt to sabotage the research unsuccessfully on one occasion.
<br>Beyond a certain concentration, this effect stops, 1:250th being the upper limit. It is speculated that this is because the body can no longer effectively absorb the compounds particulates at this scale.
<br>Subjects DO NOT maintain durability at smaller scales, early tests involved the injury of numerous participants during initial trials.
<br>Subjects report an increased sense of smell and taste, with the smaller the scale, the more intense these sensations.

 <br><br>The current story involves a corporate cold war primary focusing on two corporations operating within the United States both with similar goals but differing backers.<br>
AMF is a PMC group formed in the aftermath of the soviet union, and began operating in the states in the 2000s. As its power grew, so did interest from the Russian Government, as well as the CCP. Their involvement in AMF has been kept deniable but is all but in writing.<br>
Equinox is a PMC and research group with deep ties to the US intelligence committee and acts as a covert third arm of the USA. Assisting in operations where the US would rather not get their hands dirty, and has the added benefit of operating with all the capitalist freedoms of a private company.<br>
Both have developed size shifting tech, albeit through different means and with drawbacks.<br>
Both companies are currently working on investigating people of interest for either reasons related to size tech, or for reasons related to other company affairs completely separate from size. Both companies attempt to sabotage each other occasionally.<br><br><br>
<br>Faster Activating (almost instant), not chemical based, wears off in about a day for shrink, in a couple hours for growth.
<br>Relies on an otherworldly entity for further development. 
<br>Process is incredibly energy intensive, and currently extremely expensive.
<br>Entity responsible for it's creation no longer under AMF control.
<br>Development has plateaued at a point where there are these drawbacks, all efforts now focused on making it cheaper.
<br>Subjects are extremely delicate when small, but extremely strong when large.
<br>Effect can be used offensively in the form of electromagnetic pulses, however this requires specialized equipment that needs to be mounted to a vehicle to be portable at all.
<br><br>
<br>Acts over about 30s.
<br>Still rather expensive, but chemical based so can be manufactured.
<br>Subjects are still extremely delicate when small.
<br>Effect does not wear off unless an anti-compound is administered.
<br>Subjects can shrink smaller than Project Archangel, with the limit being 1/250 rather than 1/175.
<br>Effect can be used offensively in the form of gas grenades or poison.
<br><br>
<br>Radiation Based, Cheap
<br>Irreversible.
<br>Results in a loss of original body, an ability to clone a vessel is needed for it to be effective.
<br>Memories are transferred between "lives" via a quantum entanglement like phenomena altering the original capture as the current clone creates new memories.
